# HTML & CSS Sign-Up Form

A responsive and clean sign-up form template built entirely with modern HTML5 and CSS3. This project provides a foundational frontend for a user registration page, featuring a centered layout and a card-based design.

## Features

-   **Modern Design**: A clean, card-based layout with box-shadow and rounded corners.
-   **Responsive Layout**: Uses CSS Flexbox to ensure the form is perfectly centered on all screen sizes.
-   **Interactive Elements**: The submit button has a hover effect for better user feedback.
-   **Structured Form**: The form is logically divided into "Personal Information" and "Login Credentials" sections.
-   **Basic Validation**: Employs the HTML5 `required` attribute to ensure users fill out important fields.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the form.
-   **CSS3**: For all styling, including Flexbox for the layout and transitions for visual effects.
-   **JavaScript**: For verifying the data entered.
